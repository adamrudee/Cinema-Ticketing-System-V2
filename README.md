# Cinema-Ticketing-System-V2
This Java-based project is a Cinema Ticketing System that aims to simplify and automate the process of reserving movie tickets.  It features an easy-to-use interface for viewing movie schedules, selecting seats, and purchasing tickets.  The technology is aimed for both cinema personnel and consumers, with the goal of reducing human errors and increasing ticket administration efficiency.

 The system is written in Java and employs object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, resulting in code that is modular, reusable, and simple to maintain.  Special features include real-time seat availability and data management via file or database interface.
